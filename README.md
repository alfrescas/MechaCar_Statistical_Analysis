# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview

AutoRUs' new prototype is not running well, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. The upper management has asked the data analytics team to review the production data. In this data analysis, it will show the following:
  - Use a multiple linear regression analysis to identify and predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
  - Run a summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
  - Run t-tests to see if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
  - To do a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
